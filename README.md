## Objectives

1. Build a small Rails project
2. Be able to create basic models, migrations, controllers, and views

## Instructions

For this mini project, you'll create a small Rails app. The topic is open-ended. You could build a small recipe app, or a todo list, or even a small blogging platform.

### Requirements
- Have at least 3 distinct models
- There should be at least one many-to-many relationship 
- Hit at least 1 API
- Create seed data 

### Ultra Bonus
- Write model tests 
- Practice refactoring
- Make it pretty with Bootstrap or Materialize (look into the [Rails Asset Pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html))
